# ShopApp

A simple frontend application using Angular, Tailwind.css and faker.
Goal is to prototype the user interface of a webshop cart for a coding challenge.

The frontend provides a basic list of products to put into a cart, 
using FakerJS for mockup product names and images.


See `/docs` for further information on [basic app functionality](./docs/app_functions.md). and the [Entity Relationship Model](./docs/entity_relationship_modell.md).

## Build Info

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests (Not Implemented)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests (Not Implemented)

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
